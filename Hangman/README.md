# Hangman

Source code can be found in "main.cpp"

This game of hangman allows users to either play solo or with a friend.

In solo play, a txt file of words can be loaded in to be chosen from at random. A provided words.txt has been included, using the top 1000 English words from a website online. However, one can create their own txt files, as long as each word is on one line.

In multiplayer mode, one person would type in the word and then the other person/people would guess.

To run this game, download the executable and use command line in the directory you are located in, in the format

./Hangman words.txt

Note that your txt file does not have to be words.txt, and can be any txt file that meets the conditions of one word per line.
