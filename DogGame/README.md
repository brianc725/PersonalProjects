# DogGame
This "game" involves a person adopting a dog, in which that person is able to name that dog and then move onto walking, feeding, or teaching the dog tricks.

# Game guide:
  
  Walking the dog decreases the dog's health by 1.
  
  Feeding the dog increases the dog's health by 1.
  
  To teach a dog a trick, the percentage needs to hit 100%, which then the dog will be able to perform the trick properly, and also decrease in health by 1. Every 2 days that the trick is performed, the dog will "forget" and will have to relearn it, and again the percentage must hit 100%
